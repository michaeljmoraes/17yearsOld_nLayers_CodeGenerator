<h1>TextBox</h1>
<p>TextBox is a ASP-like script host that will process any file you give it looking
for: </p>
<ul>
<li>text blocks
<li>script blocks (&lt;% script %&gt;)
<li>output blocks (&lt;%= output %&gt;)
<li>An optional language block as the first line in the file <i>only</i> (&lt;%@ language= language %&gt;)<br>
(TextBox defaults to vbscript and currently only works with vbscript and jscript).</ul>

<p>TextBox pre-processes the text to turn the whole thing
into into script and hands it to the scripting engine for execution,
outputting the result to standard out. Whatever features of the scripting language
you want to use, feel free. </p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To provide for I/O, TextBox emulates ASP somewhat. It provides two intrinsics,
the request object and the response object. The Request object has a
single property, QueryString, that works just like ASP. The Response object
has a single property, Write, just like ASP. In fact, if you only use 
Request.QueryString and Response.Write, you should be able to test your
script files using ASP. </p>
<p>
To set name/value pairs for use by the script via the Request object, the usage of TextBox is like so:

    <pre>    usage: textbox &lt;file&gt; [name=value]</pre>

<p>For example, to interpret the file above, any of the following command lines would work:
</p>

    <pre>    textbox test.cpp.asp
    textbox test.cpp.asp greeting=&quot;Double Wahoo!&quot;
    textbox test.cpp.asp iostream=true greeting=&quot;Double Wahoo!&quot;
    </pre>

<p>The first would yield the following output: </p>

    <pre>    // test.cpp

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {
        printf(&quot;Hello, World.\n&quot;);
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>while the last would yield the following: </p>

    <pre>    // test.cpp

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Double Wahoo!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>

<h1>Errors and Debugging</h1>
<p>If the scripting engine finds an error, it will notify TextBox, who will notify
you. However, if you've got script debugging enabled on your machine, the
scripting engine will ask you if you'd like to fire up the debugger, showing
you exactly the offending code. </p>

<h1>Not Just Code</h1>
<p>Of course, TextBox is good for the generation of any text, not just code. </p>
